# customESC
This repository contains the complete design files and documentation for a **custom Electronic Speed Controller (ESC)** PCB, tailored specifically for **Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)**. The design addresses common issues faced in off-the-shelf ESCs, such as dimensional constraints and component compatibility.

##  About the Project

Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs) are essential components in UAVs, responsible for regulating the speed of the brushless DC motors based on flight controller signals. This custom ESC is designed from the ground up to meet UAV-specific requirements such as:

- Optimized form factor for tight integration into drone frames
- Thermal performance and current handling capabilities
- Ease of firmware customization for advanced control

---

##  Key Features

- **Custom PCB Layout** for compact integration in UAV systems
- **Designed with real-world components** in mind, addressing availability and size constraints
- **Supports ChibiOS**, a real-time open-source operating system for embedded applications
- **Open-source hardware**, allowing for easy modifications and improvements
- **Modular architecture** to interface with standard BLDC drivers and sensors

##  Why ChibiOS?

This ESC design is fully compatible with **ChibiOS**, a lightweight and efficient real-time operating system (RTOS) widely used in embedded systems. ChibiOS offers:

- Preemptive multitasking
- HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) for easy peripheral access
- Fast context switching ideal for ESC control loops
- A large and active open-source community

With ChibiOS, developers can create **custom ESC firmware** with features such as regenerative braking, custom motor control algorithms, telemetry integration, and more.
